    &emsp; Low-poly backgrounds, when done right, look pretty cool. I built a
    tool to make them a couple years back, but I was dissatisfied because all
    the simple designs (geometric backgrounds, colored triangles, etc.) seemed
    a bit boring, and it was exceedingly hard to recreate real-life scenes with
    the tool I had built.

    &emsp; Throughout college I amassed a library of photos I had taken, and it
    seemed like the right time to build something that could give them a 
    low-poly style. This new tool lets you put in a picture and pick the 
    vertices of your triangles, and then it generates a low-poly cover of the
    image that you can flatten onto the image with your favorite photo editor.
    It does a Delaunay Triangulation on those vertices, and each triangle's
    color is set to be the color of the pixel at the centroid (center of mass)
    of the triangle.

    &emsp; For the picture up top, I used the tool on a photo of a brown spotted
    jellyfish at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. If you look close, you can see that I've done a pretty sloppy job
    near the ends of the jelly's tentacles. It's covered up by the dock on my phone
    so I've left it as it is. Eventually I'll give the tool a little more visual polish, and one of my
    goals is to automate point selection based off of colors and edges, but for
    now, here it is:

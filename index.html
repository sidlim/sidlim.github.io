            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Sid. I'm a student at UCSD, and I study bioinformatics,
                math, and computer science. A couple of my hobbies are surfing,
                math, reading, and baking. I'm really curious about how the
                world works, and so here you'll (eventually) find my projects,
                which are directed lines of inquiry about topics that I find
                interesting, and explorables, which are interactive, accessible
                explanations of those same topics.

            <h2>Influences and Inspirations</h2>
            I've picked up a lot of my views about understanding the world
            and communicating from a couple of influential people. Here are
            just a few:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Steven Wittens' fantastic blog was the
                    <a href='https://acko.net/'>reason I developed a passion
                        for math.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bret Victor has done a lot of
                    <a href='http://worrydream.com/'>writing about better media
                        for explanation and communication.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nicky Case has a <a href='https://ncase.me'>blog that puts
                        a lot of these ideas into practice.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Grant Sanderson's Youtube channel,
                    <a href='youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw'>
                        3Blue1Brown, is also a great channel for making light
                        of math.</a>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                I'm drawing from <a href='https://explorabl.es'>Explorables</a>
                here - first and foremost, I want this to be about explanation
                through play. I've got a bunch of my own projects which I hope
                to turn into full-fledged explorables soon enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from being a creative outlet for me, some subordinate
                goals I have for this website are accessibility and design.
                First off, you'll notice that I'm writing this website in
                semantic HTML (to the degree that I can) in order to try to
                make this site accessible to those who use a screen reader,
                or a keyboard for navigation instead of a mouse. Often times
                in my previous work design has come at a cost to
                accessibility, which I intend to avoid on this site.
